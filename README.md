- 👋 Hi there, I’m Joseph. Just your average guy trying to make an impact on the world.
- 👀 I'm interested in a variety of things; the thing that catches my interest the most right now is software development. Though I still love sports, board games, video games, reading, and art!
- 🌱 As you might have guessed from the previous statement, I’m currently learning computer science fundamentals at UW-Whitewater. I'm also learning about how to make a game in Unity too, just for a personal project of mine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that align with my interests (mainly software development though)
